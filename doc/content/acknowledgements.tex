\section{Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:Acknowledgements}

I would like to acknolwedge \citet{rbruce1998} and \citet{amackworth1998} for
their coursework materials on iterative deepening A Star searches, as well as
\citet{canderson2012} for his notes on his space and time complexity for
the uninformed searches used in this assignment.

Additionally, the article provided by \citet{redblob2014} helped me optimise
my search algorithms significantly, especially with the \texttt{came\_from}
concept rather than using a Set of explored nodes, which is what I was
additionally doing.
