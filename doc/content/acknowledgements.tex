\section{Acknowledgements}
\label{sec:Acknowledgements}

I would like to acknolwedge \citet{rbruce1998} and \citet{amackworth1998} for
their coursework materials on iterative deepening A Star searches, as well as
\citet{canderson2012} for his notes on his space and time complexity for
the uninformed searches used in this assignment. \citet{aima2009} was used for
reference in all required search implementations also, chiefly in their provided
psuedo-code for the algorithms.

Additionally, the article provided by \citet{redblob2014} helped me optimise
my search algorithms significantly, with the \texttt{came\_from} hashmap data
structure rather than using a set of explored nodes. This reduced search time
for all search methods, especially with \texttt{BFS} which dropped from about 30
seconds to 8 seconds.
