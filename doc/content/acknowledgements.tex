I would like to acknolwedge \citet{rbruce1998} and \citet{amackworth1998} for
their coursework materials on iterative-deepening A* searches, as well as
\citet{canderson2012} for his notes on his space and time complexity for
the uninformed searches used in this assignment. \citet{aima2009} was used for
reference in all required search implementations also, chiefly in their provided
psuedo-code for the algorithms.

Additionally, the article provided by \citet{redblob2014} helped me optimise
my search algorithms significantly. For random state generation, I utilised
several theorms devised by \citet{gong2000}, which you can see implemented in
the \texttt{RandomState.swift} file.

When researching variant heuristics, I utilised works by \citet{deza2009} for
implementing Euclidean distance, \citet{cantrell2000modern} for Chebyshev
distance, and lastly \citet{krause2012taxicab} for Manhattan distance
implementation.
