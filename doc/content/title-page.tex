\begin{abstract}
  A tree-based search can be implemented with both uninformed (brute-force) and
  informed (heurstic-based) searches. This assignment implements a small program
  demonstrating both types via an AI solver of an $n$ by $m$ puzzle. Utilised
  in the solver is Breadth-First and (Iterative-Deepening) Depth-First uninformed
  searches, Greedy-Best First and (Iterative-Deepening) A* Search informed
  searches.
