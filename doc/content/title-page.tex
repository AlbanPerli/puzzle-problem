\begin{abstract}
  A tree-based search can be implemented with both uninformed (brute-force) and
  informed (heurstic-based) searches. This assignment implements a small program
  depmonstrating both types via an AI solver of an $n$ by $m$ puzzle. Utilised
  in the solver is Breadth-First, Depth-First and Depth-Limited uninformed
  searches, Greedy-Best First, and (Iterative Deepening) A Star Search
  informed searches.
